# Brainfuck interpreter
Interpreter for the brainfuck esoteric programming language, written in C. Details about brainfuck can be found [here](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Brainfuck).

## How to use
Download and compile [main.c](https://github.com/pawelfron/brainfuck_interpreter/blob/master/main.c). To run a brainfuck program, simply write the path to the source file following the name of the executable.

I will (probably) provide sample programs in `examples`, right now there is only a "Hello world".
